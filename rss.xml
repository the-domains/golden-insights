            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Three Keys to Managing a Creative Team</h1><p>As a leader of a creative team, it's so gratifying to see my team's work on display.

Although my creative staff is responsible for doing the heavy lifting, my responsibility is to insure that they have the right resources, the appropriate direction, and the information needed to deliver websites, videos, presentations, print pieces, and business solutions that delight our clients.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7700b8998134726d8ce4b8de2ff397ee254b2ecc.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>"Vintage" has no business in business process</h1><p>A number of years ago, I interviewed someone for a business analyst position, and the interviewee referred to an old process as a "vintage process." I chuckled when he uttered the phrase, because those two words just don't go together.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ce4fadfc24beed17d02f7695730164596d99d7d5.jpg"></article>]]></description>
