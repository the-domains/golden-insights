            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Three Keys to Managing a Creative Team</h1><p>As a leader of a creative team, it's so gratifying to see my team's work on display.

I chuckled when he uttered the phrase, because those two words just don't go together.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/82d1cc8eec1d5ac3af484b670a93522c8bd7bca0.jpg"></article>]]></description>
