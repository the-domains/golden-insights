# Three Keys to Managing a Creative Team

As a leader of a creative team, it's so gratifying to see my team's work on display. I'm proud that my small team regularly completes over 60 deliverables a month that help our company communicate to our employees, our clients, and our partners. Although my creative staff is responsible for doing the heavy lifting, my responsibility is to insure that they have the right resources, the appropriate direction, and the information needed to deliver websites, videos, presentations, print pieces, and business solutions that delight our clients.

I do everything in my power to free my team from negotiating deadlines, prioritizing projects, and making decisions that don't add to the creative process. 

I've learned that creativity only happens when creative people are free to create. So, to keep my team focused and successful on their creative tasks, I make sure the following are in place:

* Strong processes
* Open communication channels
* Empowered team members

## Creative teams need strong processes

I would never feel comfortable with my project manager shooting video, writing code, or designing websites.  So, why would I feel comfortable with my creative professionals doing project management?

My team becomes frustrated when project management or other administrative tasks seep into their daily regimen. Any task that is not related to the creative process takes away from a creative team's value proposition. To eliminate this frustration and mitigate against stressful moments, repeatable processes should be put in place. At minimum the following processes should be defined so that a creative team members' time and energy is not burdened with administrative tasks:

* **Intake Processes**. An effective intake process will allow the creative team to have limited visibility to the project pipeline until their expertise is needed. Intake should be in the hands of a project manager, traffic manager, or team manager.
* **Approval Processes.**All projects have approval checkpoints along the way, but many approvals do not need to involve the creative team. For example, final approval from clients and approvals from the legal team need no creative involvement. Instead, these approval processes should be managed and facilitated by administrative team members.
* **Reporting Processes**. Creative teams, like any other team, are responsible for insuring their clients know that progress is being made on their projects, but if the creative staff is busy sending out progress updates, their time is not being well spent. Reporting, like other administrative process need not be in the hands of the creative team. 

If the creative team must be engaged in these administrative processes, they should know exactly how they should be involved. Templates should be at their disposal and the process should be consistent for each project. The main takeaway here is that an effective creative team should spend as little time as possible on non-creative activities. Strong processes can help make this possible.

## Creative teams need open communication channels

For one reason or another, project managers sometimes end up gathering requirements or conducting ad hoc "visioning" meetings without a creative team member present. Although the project manager feels like he or she just added value to the process, the graphic designer is at risk of  creating something that is not what the client expected or desired. Then the graphic designer is frustrated when he/she gets the less than complimentary feedback, the project manager is embarrassed, and the client has lost confidence in the creative team. No one is happy.

This type of situation can be avoided if the communication channels between the creative staff and the client are opened as early as appropriate in the project lifecycle.

> Any type of conversation that allows the creative team members to understand client expectations are valuable conversations.

Opening communication channels early ensures robust collaboration, accurate transfer of knowledge, and healthy relationships between the creative staff and the client, project manager and other creative staff members. 

Although the creative team should be insulated from as many administrative tasks as possible, they should be in the thick of all discussions that add value to the creative process. Any type of conversation that allows the creative team members to understand client expectations are valuable conversations.

## Creative teams need empowered team members

Creative team members should not be considered order-takers if you want them to be engaged and inspired to produce quality creative deliverables. Few highly skilled and creative employees are comfortable receiving orders without the opportunity to provide their insight. The occasional non-negotiable request is expected, but should be the exception to the rule if your creative team is to be happy, engaged and, well, creative.

The small video team I work with is regularly asked to produce videos where a simple email or a well constructed infographic may have provided more value and/or a better return on investment. Some clients are very receptive to our feedback if we think we can provide something other than a video to meet their needs. Other clients don't want to discuss anything other than a video for their project. In these cases, we will always support our clients, but it's obvious to everyone on our team that our hearts aren't into the project.

When clients know up-front that our staff is more than just a group of order takers, our creative staff is empowered to help support clients in new ways. This leads to a more engaged team leading to better outcomes for all. 

## Creativity doesn't just happen

As a manager of a team of creative professionals, I know that I can't just put the team in place and walk away. No matter how skilled or experienced the team members, the right environment needs to be put in place--an environment that includes repeatable processes, open communication channels, and empowered team members.
