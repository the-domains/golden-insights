# "Vintage" has no business in business process

Vintage: Representing the high quality of a past time.\*

A number of years ago, I interviewed someone for a business analyst position, and the interviewee referred to an old process as a "vintage process." I chuckled when he uttered the phrase, because those two words just don't go together.

Vintage cars, or jeans, or t-shirts evoke a sense of nostalgia and affection, because they have gracefully stood the test of time. I'm not much of a car guy, but when I see a vintage car, I can't help but to stare. Show me a vintage concert tee, and I may embarrass my kids by yelling "cool shirt!"

A vintage business process, on the other hand, makes me cringe.  If a company's processes have earned vintage status, most likely that company is no longer a leader. The classic Harvard Business Review article,["Why Good Companies Go Bad"][0] points out that routinized processes cause "active inertia," which is to blame for the downfall of companies such as Laura Ashley, Firestone, and Xerox. There are just too many forces pushing processes to change, including customers' expectations, new technologies and competitive pressures for a company to remain successful without changing processes. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9b29f390-f794-4f43-a907-97cffc662155.png)

Some key signals that your company has a vintage process include:

* The prevailing culture supports "this is the way we've always done it, and it works well."
* Leaders claim that "this is what set us apart from the competition and helped us get to our IPO."
* IT complains that the legacy system has been around since dirt making innovation difficult.

Companies that know how to adapt through process improvement are able to remain relevant. An adaptable [retail company][1], for example, will be able to deliver a new personalized digital customer experience. An adaptable automobile company (like[Toyota][2]) will develop alternative powertrains to add to their current offerings. An adaptable digital company (like[Netflix][3]) will add their own valuable content to diversify and stand apart from their competition.  

Successful companies relentlessly reevaluate how they deliver their products by questioning the value proposition of each and every step along the way. These winning companies fight through structural pressures; their cultures support change; and their employees understand the benefit of process change--and they wait to express their love of vintage until the workday is done.
