# Using the Four Layers Of Identity To Become A Leader

Recently, I came across some work I did while I was in graduate school, which took me down a nostalgic and intellectual rabbit hole. As a graduate student, I was introduced to the Communication Theory of Identity by my mentor Dr. Michael Hecht. His theory provided me a framework for much of my graduate work.  With over a decade and a half of professional life under my belt, the Communication Theory of Identity is still as relevant to me now as it was when I was writing papers and defending my thesis. (Yes, graduate school _was _worth it!)

Among other things, Dr. Hecht's  framework (learn more [here][0] and [here][1]), states that there are four frames or layers of identity that play off each other:

* Personal Layer: Our self-image and self-concept as well as how people perceive us are tied up in the personal frame. At the personal frame, identity defines characteristics of the self.
* Enactment Layer: Our identities emerge from what we say and do and how we act in certain situations. Behaviors not only allow people and communities to express an identity, but the behaviors themselves can define identity.  
* Relationship Layer: Relationships are key to identity construction. The relationships we have with bosses, friends, and teammates all help to construct identity and these relationships have identities themselves. 
* Communal Layer: The communal frame is where identity emerges and manifests at the group level. Companies, business units and teams have identities that are jointly held by employees.  The communal frame is powerful, because it helps set behavioral expectations for people in the group and outside the group.

None of these frames stand on their own. They are interrelated, sometimes creating tension and always being negotiated. 

These four layers of identity can be helpful in understanding and creating a strong corporate culture and rich employee engagement. To have an engaged workforce, leaders of companies must make decisions based on the interplay between the personal, enactment, relational, and communal identities.

The next time you find yourself asking questions about what it will take to be a better leader, consider the four frames of identity when communicating with your employees. The relationship between managers and employees is the single most important relationship when it comes to employee engagement and creating corporate identity, because a manager has an impact on all four layers of identity. Below are just some examples of how a boss/employee relationship impacts the identity of an employee and ultimately the culture of an organization.

* Bosses help employees understand company policies (Communal layer).
* Bosses assign work (Enactment Layer) which forms the core of how an employee defines his or her professional identity (Personal Layer).
* Bosses communicate with their employees (Enactment Layer) in ways that ultimately create a reputation. The communication style of a manager has a direct relationship to how he/she is perceived and labeled. For example, a boss's behavior can result in he or she being known as sensitive, competent, ruthless, or arrogant (Personal Layer).
* Bosses provide feedback (implicit and explicit) that greatly impacts how an employee views himself/herself (Personal Layer).
* Bosses and employees create relationships with employees that can be defined as collaborative, supportive, dysfunctional or ambivalent (Relational layer).
* Bosses provide a vision for how a company or department will succeed (Communal layer).
* Bosses hire and fire employees (Enactment Layer).
* The list  goes on...

No wonder the employee experience is so tied up in the relationship between employees and their supervisors! A boss has a direct impact on the identity of each and every employee he or she supervises. Leaders (implicitly or explicitly) understand this complicated web of identities and make decisions accordingly.

As a manager, keep the four layers of identity top of mind. Every time you communicate with your employees, you have an impact on the identity of yourself, your employees and your company.
